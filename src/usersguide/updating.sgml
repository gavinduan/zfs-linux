<title>Updating the Roll</title>

<para>
ZFS on Linux is still an in-development software and has reasonably frequent
updates. It is often useful to update the zfs software without resorting to
a full reinstallation of a system.  This section will describe how to do that
and at the same time make sure the roll is in the <emphasis>local cluster</emphasis> distribution.    
</para>

<para>
This version of the zfs-linux roll requires you to manually build and add the binary version 
of the roll.
</para>

<warning>
<para>
The roll follows the process at http://zfsonlinux.org to build rpms.  This has the effect of 
installing zfs kernel modules on your frontend. If you do not want this, then you should
build on a development server appliance.
</para>

<title>Getting the updated roll source</title>

<para>
If the ZFS source roll is not available for the version of ZFS-on-Linux that
you require, then you should go to git.rocksclusters.org. In particular,
<computeroutput>http://http://git.rocksclusters.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=core/zfs-linux/.git;a=summary</computeroutput>.   The simplest is to retrieve a
snapshot of either the labeled version of the Roll, or the "master/origin".
On the page above, there is a "snapshot" link that, when selected, will create
a tar.gz file of the roll.   Download this file and unpack it the contents in a local directory. The following, uses revision 32495f5 as an example
<screen>
# cd /opt/zfs/zfs-linux-roll-source
# tar xvf  zfs-linux-32495f5.tar.gz
# cd zfs-linux-32495f5
# make binary-roll
</screen>
</para>
<note>
<para>
Please see the section on "Installing the Roll" to see a proper build. Remember to add the binary roll (iso image) that was created above and then recreate 
the distribution on the frontend
</para>
</note>
<para>
Now that your updated binary has been created, you can update the RPMS of 
a system that has its ZFS RPMS already installed. On the node (this works also for a frontend)
<screen>
# yum clean all 
# yum update 
# reboot 
</screen>
</para>

<para>
You may see an error that lsscsi package does not exist. This is because the 
package is not part of the standard OS roll, but is part of the CentOS
Distribution. To fix this problem
<screen>
# yum --enable-repo=base install lsscsi 
# yum update
# reboot
</screen>
</para>
