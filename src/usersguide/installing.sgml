<para>
The zfs-linux roll is supplies ZFS in source form <emphasis>ONLY</emphasis>.
This is to comply with the licensing of ZFS that does not allow binary redistribution.
This means that ZFS must be built on your frontend and the binaries added to your 
<emphasis>local cluster</emphasis> distribution.    
</para>

<para>
This edition of the zfs-linux roll requires you to manually build and add the binary version 
of the roll.
</para>

<warning>
<para>
The roll follows the process at http://zfsonlinux.org to build rpms.  This has the effect of 
installing zfs kernel modules on your frontend. If you do not want this, then you should
build on a development server appliance.
</para>
</warning>

<para>
If you choose the zfs-linux roll from a Rocks central server, you the source form of the roll will be installed for you.
You must then go to the directory  <computeroutput>/opt/zfs/zfs-linux-roll-source</computeroutput> and build the binary version
of the roll. The files in that directory are contained in the called <computeroutput>zfs-linux-roll-source-0.6.0-rc12.x86_64.rpm</computeroutput>. This source can be installed on a Rocks Development Server. To make the <emphasis> binary </emphasis> version of the roll
<screen>
# cd /opt/zfs/zfs-linux-roll-source
# make binary-roll
</screen>
</para>
<para>
If your roll rebuild completed properly, you should see output similar to the following indicating the

</para>
<para>
If you build on a development server, you must first copy the created iso image to the frontend.
Once you have the iso image (in the directory where you made the binary roll on the frontend or copied
to the frontend from a development server, you need to add the roll and rebuild the distribution.
<screen>
# rocks add roll zfs-linux*iso
# rocks enable roll zfs-linux
# pushd /export/rocks/install
# rocks create distro
# popd
</screen>
</para>

<para>
At this point, any <emphasis>client</emphasis> nodes can be reinstalled with
ZFS support. You can enable ZFS on your frontend by "running" the roll on the frontend  
<screen>
# rocks run roll zfs-linux | sh
</screen>
</para>

<title>Enabling ZFS Support on nodes/appliances</title>
<para>
Any node or appliance can have ZFS support added to it. Whether or not ZFS is installed on a node is controlled
by an attribute called <computeroutput>zfs</computeroutput>. The attribute should be set to true, if ZFS support is
desired for the node.
</para>
<para>
Example: to enable ZFS on all NAS appliances, do the following
<screen>
# rocks add appliance attr nas attr=zfs value=true 
</screen>
